Straight out of the box, iPad mini is ready for big things. Map out your next adventure. Then shoot it in 1080p HD. Watch a webcast or a film. Read a best-seller or a magazine. Check email. Send messages. Or stay in touch face to face over FaceTime. You'll be amazed at how much is built right in. Over 300,000 apps from the App Store.
